## Results
Pictured bellow is temperature readings from the weather station outside my house over 1 day and night. notice how the high point around 45c (mesured in celcius) corrisponds to the day and the nigh time is low with 5c. the data is skused because the weather station was on top of a barbicue and thouse got hotter then the abent temperature outside (oh well face emoji).
